Hi everyone!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Diego Armando SantillÃ¡n Arriaga, I'm an applied math undergraduate passionate about the design and implementation
of artificial inteligence and machine learning models for providing solutions through data leveraging. I'm experienced in data cleaning and preprocessing 
and in the application of classical machine learning algorithms as well as feedforward neural networks. As an ever challenge driven person, I constantly 
look to enhance my domain of these tools and I'm eager to collaborate on any exciting projects that implement them! Feel free to contact me through my LinkIn profile 
or via email anytime!
